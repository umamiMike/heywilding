# Hi! I'm Mike Wilding


I Love Telling Awesome Stories, Often with Code.

If your website or app isn’t functioning well, I can help you. With over five
years of experience as a full stack-developer, I can build apps from scratch,
fix bugs, and turn a website or application from rough to robust.

Since 2017, I’ve been working for enterprise industries in health care,
e-commerce, and property tech. My tasks were to implement features and find
novel solutions to engineering challenges within mature codebases. Before then,
I owned an animation and visual effects company, where I produced media for
clients and translated their ideas into moving images.

I am collaborative, creative, and have deep knowledge of how to solve problems
fast.

<!-- I will keep in touch with you at each stage of your project. -->

- Integrate third party API (Stripe, social media, mailing lists, etc)

- Use responsive design to ensure that your site or app works on different platforms
- Provide transparency in the development process by adhering to Agile methodologies
