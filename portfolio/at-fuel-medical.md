- Implemented a host of new features involving every aspect of the LAMP stack.
- Managed Google Cloud VM instances with the Google Cloud SDK and Chef for large scale streaming practice conversions.
- Implemented unit testing in a large untested codebase using PHPUnit.
- Championed and helped create requirements documentation, facilitating greater stakeholder buyin, fewer edge-case errors.
- I worked toward team communication around software support leading to the hiring of a "Customer Advocate"  product-owner like position, focusing the teams efforts toward better ends.
- created scripted tools to solve problems specific to my position
- I solved problems with time lost to developer confusion by creating a Makefile for most of our dev-environment related activities, increasing efficiency and an easier shared team experience.
- Implemented functional programming paradigms in a PHP application dominated with overloaded controllers.


- While working at Fuel, I broke the monolithic PHP framework into chunks using Docker with a goal of being able to deploy to Kubernetes

- Something about HIPAA compliance
- created a tool to anonymize data while maintaining HIPAA compliance using Go and a faking library.
