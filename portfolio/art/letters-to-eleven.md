## Letters to Eleven

This is a Multimedia Performance piece I created a few years ago to mark the entrance in to the world of a new life. It is in 3 parts with interstitial animations and video. The piece was presented as a part of that years Winterfest in conjunction with Joe Leonardi's "Media Mania" Series.

The stories told are meant as communications from an adult to an unborn child. Since the gender of the child was unknown there is a Female story and a Male story.

Introduction
Involves pictures taken during pregnancy...oh and a 3d peanut. Who woulda thunk it.

### Part I

"The Box" Performed by Carrie Emrich

### Part II

"Deadly Accuracy with a Snowball" Performed by Jon Plueard.

### Part III

"Peanuts First Dance" Performed by Tanya Ignacio and Peanut/Eleven

The music was composed and performed by me. Carrie Emrich provided the vocals.

The Live performance was entitled "Letters To Peanut" Peanut was his name before he had a name and before anyone knew he was a he. Now that he is Eleven the name of the recording is "Letters To Eleven"

I hope you enjoy it.
