### Exhibit for Oregon Historical Society

MySQL, PHP, Flash

We were hired to implement the tech for the first installation of [Oregon Voices](https://www.ohs.org/museum/exhibits/oregon-voices.cfm) by the [Sockeye Agency](https://sockeye.com/)

- The exhibit called for six separate flash based touch screen kiosks for museum exhibit-goers to be able to watch various videos created for the exhibit.
- There was a questionnaire people could take at each kiosk.
- Their votes would be taken in by the Flash application in 1 of 6 Kiosks, read into PHP from actionscript, where the vote was saved to a MySQL database.
- The data was retrieved by final server/screen at the end of the exhibit which would display a rotating series of bar graphs showing the results to date in real time.
