## Observations and notes from a really great youtube creator

Andrew Spiess probably does not have ADHD, but I found has perspective in his
video [#319 Is your Information Management ok? -
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7Aydaqe_OE&t=229s) to be very useful.

## Here are some of my takeaways

### as simple as possible but not simpler

This has been a hard won concept for me. I have often made things WAY more
complicated than they need to be. I have learned a great deal from my more
experienced friends in software AND my wife. She has a wonderful ability to go
straight for the most appropriate solution for NOW, as opposed to attempting to
make some kind of [Rube Goldberg](https://www.illustrationhistory.org/artists/rube-goldberg) conceptually poetic solution.

### **Time** is a Principal Organizer

Boy dont I know it. I am really glad I dont have a complete datalog of how much

I dont do that, but maybe I will someday.

### Finding is better than filing, as it takes much less time

For me searching is as simple as `nvim ** <TAB>`. which triggers
[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) for anything on my computer.

### Use full text search with tags

10. I have full text search BUT not tagging

### Tags AND folders is overkill

I have learned this the hard way after having spent an inordinate amount of time
thinking about which FOLDER something should go in, since I use
[hugo](https://gohugo.io), [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), and
[fzf]() I can find what I want almost without thinking about it. This is a boon
for somebody with my neurological type.

Once I started tagging, and had full text search, It almost didnt matter where a piece of reference
